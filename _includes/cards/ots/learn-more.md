PKP has created a standalone service for converting Microsoft Word and PDF documents to structured National Library of Medicine JATS XML (used by PLoS and PubMed Central), and from there, creating attractive HTML, PDF, and ePub article views from the XML. This service is intended to decrease the labour involved in typesetting, and to facilitate the creation of archive-friendly and web-native article formats. We call it Open Typesetting Stack, or OTS for short. [Learn more about OTS](https://pkp.sfu.ca/open-typesetting-stack/).
