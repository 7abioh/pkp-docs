# Getting Found: Building Visibility

The success of your journal depends on developing a
regular readership, who will become part of your scholarly
community, cite your content in their own work,
and tell others about the value of your publication.
To do this, however, they will first need to be able to find you.
This section examines a variety of ways to increase the “findability‟ of your journal,
through the use of commercial indexes, open databases,
libraries, the media, professional networks, and professional recognition.

## Journal Standards and Identifiers

By Roger Gillis

There are several different standards and identifiers
that are commonly used in academic publishing,
and it is important for journal managers
to become familiar with them and the role
that they play in the operation of the journal.
Although not exhaustive, this section will cover the most important
ones: ISSN (International Standard Serial Number), Digital Object Identifier (DOI),
and ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID).


### ISSNs

An important way of helping people find your journal,
and helping libraries and other organizations to make it discoverable, is to obtain an
International Standard Serial Number (ISSN). An ISSN is an eight digit,
international standard, which allows for any serial publication (i.e. any publication
that is published on a repeating or “serial”  basis -- journal, magazine, etc.) regardless
 of where it is published, the medium, language, or frequency of publication.
ISSNs are widely used by libraries, citation indexes, and the publishing industry to
uniquely identify and distinguish journals. They are often more important than the journal
title itself for serials management because they provide a consistent identifier throughout
the life of a journal. Even if the journal changes names, the ISSN remains the same. This is essential
for organizations like libraries and indexes to be able to identify and distinguish your journal.
Many external services, including indexing services, such as the [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org), require that journals have an ISSN.
A ISSN can be obtained free of charge from a [local ISSN Centre](http://www.issn.org/services/requesting-an-issn/).


![LAC ISSN](assets/chapter1/lac-issn.png)
_An example of an ISSN application from Library and Archives Canada_

ISSNs should be displayed on the journal’s website where it can be easily located, such as the footer or sidebar. If the publication has both a print and online edition, there is typically one for each. In OJS, you will be asked to enter your ISSN as part of the Journal Settings. This is used for metadata purposes and is not shown to readers. To make the ISSN visible in the journal footer, type it into the footer text field in the Website Settings. To make is visible in the sidebar, create a custom block.

For the final published version of an article (i.e., a PDF galley), you may also want to include the ISSN, along with the journal name and DOI (see below), on the final page or in the footer of the PDF of the article itself. This is important, as PDFs can be downloaded, shared via email, and become disassociated with the journal. You always want to provide an easy and obvious link back to your journal.

### Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)
The Digital Object Identifier or DOI is used to individually identify unique content. They are typically applied to journal articles, but can be used for other content types such as datasets, images, or other supplementary materials added alongside articles. DOIs are what are called “persistent identifiers” -- so even if the URL (Uniform Resource Locator - in other words, a website link) for a journal changes, the DOI remains the same and can be used to link to an article. DOIs are becoming increasingly common and their use is seen as an indicator of the professionalism of the journal, so it is important to take them seriously.

#### The anatomy of a DOI
A DOI consists of a series of characters divided into two parts -- a prefix and a suffix, which are separated by a slash. The prefix uniquely identifies the registrant (i.e. the publisher) of the title, and the suffix identifies the specific object. So, for example:

For, example, this article: [“Health Care Professionals’ Opinions and Expectations of Clinical Pharamacy Services on a Surgical Ward”](http://www.cjhp-online.ca/index.php/cjhp/article/view/1606)

The DOI in this case is  10.4212/cjhp.v69i6.1606

The “10.” part of the prefix identifies the DOI registry - the agency that issues the DOI numbers, in this example, Crossref. The characters “4212” in the prefix identify the registrant - in this case, the publisher: Multimed. And the cjhp.v69i6.1606, the suffix, consists of several different parts, meant to distinguish the particular content:

“cjhp” --  is an abbreviation for the journal -- The Canadian Journal of Hospital Pharmacy. This is a common feature of DOIs, where a journal will opt to be identified in a DOI by a standardized journal abbreviation. Multimed publishes multiple journals, and this helps to identify to which of its titles this article belongs.

“v69i6.1606” - is the volume number of the article (69), then the issue number (6), and finally “1606” is a unique identifier for the individual article. For journals using OJS, the DOI will be automatically generated for each article.

DOIs are capable of identifying a journal, an individual issue or volume of a journal, an individual article in a journal, or can even go so granular as to identify a table or chart in a particular article. Not all journals use an abbreviation as part of the suffix. Many use a random number that is assigned by a DOI registration agency. However, using a journal abbreviation is a good way of allowing users to more quickly identify your journal.

You may often see DOIs communicated as URLs: “https://dx.doi.org/10.4212/cjhp.v69i6.1606”. This method can be used to obtain any article that has a DOI, by indicating the DOI following the “dx.doi.org”.

#### Setting up DOIs in OJS
Journals publishing with OJS will find it very easy to work with DOIs. However, some initial setup steps are required. First, you will need to register with [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/membership/), which does require an annual fee. Further integration regarding OJS’ integration with Crossref can be found in the [Crossref manual](http://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/crossref/). You will then need to enable the DOI plugin within the OJS Journal Settings. Using [DOIs and the DOI plugin](http://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dois/) provides you with the detailed steps you need to follow to configure DOIs for OJS.

#### Registering your DOIs in OJS

Once you have joined Crossref and configured OJS to use DOIs, you will need to register your content as it is published. Again, OJS can help you with this, and the steps are outlined in the [Crossref manual]((http://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/crossref/).

### Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID)

The Open Research and Contributor ID (ORCID) is a persistent digital identifier that distinguishes one researcher or contributor from another, and is being increasingly adopted in workflows for grant and publication submission. The ORCID also serves as a means of ensuring that a researcher is accurately identified as a contributor for a particular work. This is particularly useful when authors have the same names. ORCID also ensures that works are properly attributed to authors who have undergone a legal name change.

An ORCID can be obtained by any researcher by [registering on the ORCID website](https://orcid.org/register). Registering for an ORCID is free, and filling out a basic profile takes just a few minutes.


Here’s an example of an ORCID profile: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6192-8687 for researcher and PKP Director John Willinsky.

![LAC ISSN](assets/chapter1/willinsky-orcid.png)

ORCID adoption is increasingly becoming a requirement among journal publishers and funders and many systems are using ORCIDs as a way to easily integrate author and/or contributor information into online submission forms. By identifying yourself with your ORCID in filling out a grant submission or manuscript submission form, the system that you’re entering can easily pull in all of the information contained in your ORCID profile into the registration form.


Note |
------------ |
Having a public profile also lends credibility to a researcher, allowing them to specify their education, employment, as well as published works in one central location. It also lends credibility to the journal, such as when you include the ORCID numbers for each of your editorial team members on your website. It is a valuable way to demonstrate that there are real people associated with your journal, not a list of made up names (which is seen as a sign of being a “predatory” journal).  |  

Journal managers can encourage the use of ORCIDs by authors as a means of effectively collecting up-to-date information. While it might not be appropriate to enforce the use of ORCIDs, as not all authors will have them, it could be suggested to authors that they obtain an ORCID as part of the submission process and be required upon acceptance. This information, including a link to the ORCID registration form, could be part of the journal’s submission policy and featured on the journal’s website.

For journals using OJS, the ORCID can be entered as part of a user profile (under “Public” in OJS 3):

![OJS ORCID profile](assets/chapter1/ojs3-profile-orcid.png)

The OJS registration page can also include the option for new users to use their ORCID when registering:

![OJS ORCID registration](assets/chapter1/ojs3-orcid-registration.png)


This will automatically pull their personal data (first name, last name, email, etc.) from the ORCID database into the OJS registration form.

### Metadata

Coming later.

## Search Engines

By Roger Gillis

Despite the existence of specialized research databases, many researchers begin their online investigation in a search engine, like Google. Ensuring your journal is well placed within search engine search results is therefore an important responsibility for journal managers.

### Search Engine Optimization
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) refers to the process of increasing the visibility of a website, webpages, or website content (such as your journal articles) within search engines. SEO is an important consideration for online journals seeking to draw visitors to their sites. When a researcher does a search on Google that is relevant to your subject area, you want your articles to appear as close to the top of their result list as possible. SEO can help to put you higher on that list.

Most visits to websites are driven by search engines. And two major search engines make up more than 95% of all search traffic in the United States: Google and Yahoo!-Bing alliance.  For most countries outside of the US, over 80% of search traffic comes solely from Google (with some exceptions, including Russia and China [(Fishkin & Moz, 2015)](https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo).

While most modern search engines are fairly adept at indexing sites, there are a number of things that you can do to rank higher in search engine results and draw more readers to your journal.

Search engines provide two important functions: they return results relevant to the search query, and they return results often according to popularity of the websites. Much of what is written about SEO pertains to commercially-oriented businesses and organizations seeking the maximum exposure for their brands and products via search engines. Some of these organizations have deep pockets and have invested considerable time, effort, and money on SEO. For those with limited or no budget, and with highly specialized content, there are still some simple steps you can take to raise your visibility.

Some of the best ways to ensure good SEO are based on more general principles related to modern websites and design:

* Make your website easy to use, navigate, and understand
* Provide direct, actionable information relevant to a users’ search query
* Deliver high quality, legitimate, credible content

(Source: (Fishkin & Moz, 2015)](https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo)).

Used appropriately, OJS can help you adhere to these principles, provide effective SEO for journals, and help you raise your visibility on the web.

#### Practical steps and technical issues

Search engines work by sending out automated “crawlers” across the web. These “crawlers” need to be able to visit your site and index every page. Here are some practical steps and considerations you can use in order to help crawlers index your site:

* Search engines have an easier time indexing material that is in HTML format. For OJS journals, your site is in HTML and will present no problems for crawlers. However, you should consider publishing an HTML version of your articles, as PDFs are typically not as indexable. However, steps can be taken to make PDFs more accessible to search engines. See: [10 Tips to make your PDFs SEO friendly](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/pdf-seo-best-practices/59975/):

* If you use images on your journal website or in your articles, it is advisable to use the “alt” attribute to provide search engines with a text-based description of images. This also improves the overall accessibility of your journal website, assisting users with screen readers to understand what your image was despicting. For OJS journals, you can add alt tags for the information you enter as a part of the setup process.


![Entering Alternate Text in OJS 3](assets/chapter1/alt-text.png)

Similarly, video and audio content is typically not indexed well by search engines, so providing things like transcripts can go a long way in making this content more accessible and indexed by search engines.

### Usability and User experience

Another important way to enhance your SEO is by having a modern site that provides a positive user experience:

> “Usability and user experience are second order influences on search engine ranking success. They provide an indirect but measurable benefit to a site's external popularity, which the engines can then interpret as a signal of higher quality. This is called the "no one likes to link to a crummy site" phenomenon.” [(Fishkin & Moz, 2015, p. 27)]((https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo).

For OJS users, designing an appropriate site can be achieved through the new OJS theming capabilities.  In particular, OJS 3 offers significant improvements when it comes to user experience and usability, having undergone significant user testing in its development. For guidance on how to customize the look and feel of the OJS software, please consult the [Theming Guide] (https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/pkp-theming-guide/en/).

### Getting Found and Getting Social

With the rise of social media, the sharing of content of websites (including academic articles) via social media outlets such as Facebook and Twitter has also arisen as a factor considered as part of SEO. While search engines may treat socially shared links differently than other web content, it is a factor that is taken into consideration when ranking search results (Fishkin, & Moz, 2015) Google, for example, takes into account different social sharing factors when ranking its search results.

For advice on developing a social media presence for your journal, see the section in this book on using Social Media for your Journal. Publicizing your publication and its contents through social media will help boost your search engine rankings.

### Linking up

>“Links aren't everything in SEO, but search professionals attribute a large portion of the engines' algorithms to link-related factors (see Search Engine Ranking Factors). Through links, engines can not only analyze the popularity websites and pages based on the number and popularity of pages linking to them, but also metrics like trust, spam, and authority.” (Fishkin, & Moz p.30)

Linking on the web works in two directions: links to your journal, including to your articles, from other sites and links you include on your journal to other sites. Both play an important role in SEO. The more sites that link to your journal, the more likely your journal is to rank higher in search engine rankings. Here are some easy things you can do to help get more links to your journal:

1. Hire a professional graphic designer to create a journal logo that others could use to link to your site -- the equivalent of a digital bumper sticker.
2. Have other journals in your discipline link to your site, in exchange for you linking to them.
3. Ask your professional association, universities, libraries, academics working your discipline personal websites, or other related organizations to your field to provide a link to your site on their web pages.
4. Get articles from your journal featured (and therefore linked) in a news story, media release, or blog. Media stories also tend to reach larger audiences, ensuring that your journal website is noticed by more readers than usual.

Getting linked to often comes about through letting others know about your journal and may not require any additional effort. Be wary of mass solicitation in attempting to get others to link to your site, however, as this is often seen as spam and can undermine the credibility of your journal as well as negatively impact your SEO.

Linking from your journal to other relevant sites is another important way to increase your SEO. Relevant is key here, as search engines are smart enough to recognize if you fill your site with unrelated links in an obvious attempt to raise your SEO illegitimately. Some simple ways to increase the relevant links on your website include:

1. Include links to profile pages at the home institutions for all of your editorial team and authors. Here is an example for PKP Director, [Dr. John Willinsky](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/willinsk). This not only adds many relevant links to your journal website, but also significantly boosts its credibility by demonstrating that these are all real people. A common practice of predatory journals is to make up editorial board members, or to list people without their knowledge, so this is a good way to show you are a legitimate journal.
2. Include links to the ORCIDs of your editorial team and authors. Similar to the item above, it increases relevant links and increases your credibility.
3. Add DOI links to as many items in the references of your articles as possible. This will further boost both your relevant linking and your demonstration of being a professional publication. In OJS, this can be done by adding links to the reference list entries in the PDF galleys, the HTML galleys, and on the article abstract page.
4. Create a page for relevant journals, associations, and other organizations closely associated with your journal. For example the _Canadian Journal of Sociology_ would likely link to the Canadian Sociological Association.
5. Add a relevant Twitter feed to the homepage or sidebar of your journal, displaying the latest 5 or 6 links to the latest tweets from a related hashtag.

### Evaluating Your SEO

One of the easiest ways to determine how your publication might be faring in search engines is to do some tests for keywords and phrases. Try searching for your journal name or an article title in a search engine like Google and see your journal site is being indexed. You can also use like [Google Webmaster tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/) tools to see which sites are linking to your site.

There are a wide variety of tools that can assist you with Search Engine Optimization and can help you understand the traffic that is occurring on your website. Tools such as [Google analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/)  or [Piwik](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) - for which there are plugins that you can use in OJS-- are a very popular, free, and effective ways to understand and report on traffic to your journal website. [Moz Link Explorer](https://moz.com/link-explorer) is another tool that allows you to analyze the sites that link to your website.

It takes time, practice, and experience to do SEO properly. However, there are a wide variety of tools that you can use to help grow and understand the web traffic reaching your website.

Search Engine Optimization can be intimidating, but by following some of the advice outlined in this section, you can take steps towards ensuring that your journal will be highly visible in the search engines used by researchers interested in your content.

## Indexes and Databases

Indexes and databases are online, searchable collections of information. Sometimes they only include metadata (author names, article titles, subjects, keywords, etc.) and sometimes they contain the full-text. Some of them are freely available, and some of them require individual or institutional subscriptions to access. They are typically curated for relevance and quality and will have some set of criteria for what is included. For your journal, three important things to learn are: 1) is this database relevant to my journal, 2) what are the criteria for being included, and 3) how do I submit my journal’s content.

### An introduction to indexing services

By Andrea Kosavic

Indexing services ensure that scholarly content is discoverable and accessible to the broadest possible audience. It is strategic for a journal’s content to be visible where researchers in the field are conducting their research, and this is achievable by targeting indexes favoured by scholars in a given area of study. This includes any number of open and commercial indexing services, and universal indexes like [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com).

Indexes can broadly be categorized as commercial and open. Both have their advantages and disadvantages and are explored in further detail in the sections that follow.

Those seeking maximum exposure for journals are advised to pursue inclusion in as many indexes as is appropriate and possible. It is prudent to bear in mind the significant [documented advantages of publishing in an open access format in terms of usage and impact](http://sparceurope.org/what-we-do/open-access/sparc-europe-open-access-resources/open-access-citation-advantage-service-oaca/oaca-list/): These advantages are magnified by indexing with open indexes.

It is strategic to target indexes for your journal that address the needs of the scholarly community engaging with your publication. These vary from one discipline to the next. Journal editors are advised to consult (Ulrichs Web Global Serials Directory](https://ulrichsweb.serialssolutions.com/), a commercial service for which institutional libraries may have a subscription. A common strategy is to look up comparator journals in one’s subject area within Ulrichs and explore their abstracting & indexing affiliations. This figure shows a tab that be expanded within a respective journal’s description page within Ulrichs.

![Ulrichs](assets/chapter1/ulrichs.png)




This provides an ideal starting point for identifying services to approach. [SPARC also provides a broader list of indexes to consider](http://sparc.arl.org/resources/papers-guides/journal-indexing):

### The indexing process

Different indexes will have varying criteria for including your publications’ content in their index. Depending on the index, the indexing process may require manual intervention. As an example, regular exports of metadata from your journal, sometimes in particular formats, may be required.

Some organizations may provide guidelines and their requirements for publishers providing content to them. This can be include (but is not limited to):

*Delivery mechanism (e.g. via File transfer protocol or web upload)
*Acceptance of file formats (e.g. PDF, HTML)
*Provision of metadata -- (e.g. JATS/NLM XML)

Also, bear in mind that some indexes may require that you meet certain criteria before being included in their indexes, such as reaching a minimum number of articles, or publishing a certain category of scholarly outputs (e.g. articles vs. reviews).

In OJS, there are may data export utilities, for example, plugins that export to DOAJ and PubMed, that will facilitate providing some of the necessary contents and metadata to certain indexes.

Most often, when an independently published publication such as a journal seeks to partner with a commercial indexing service for inclusion with a particular commercial database or index, they will often be presented with a legal agreement.

If at all possible, it is advisable to seek legal counsel, or advice from those knowledgeable in electronic licensing, to review this document to ensure that it is in the best interest of your journal/publication.

Some things to be wary of:

If the commercial index asks for “exclusive” rights to index your publication, this is problematic. This means that you may not be free to provide other entities (commercial or non-commercial)  with the ability to index your content. Granting the indexing organization “non-exclusive” rights is much better as it frees your journal to seek out other indexing partnerships and not be limited to indexing in just one database, or with one commercial vendor.

The amount of time between the provision of your content to the vendor (e.g. PDF files and article metadata) may vary from one subject index to the next. The vendor will typically provide some mechanism for correction of errors in the guidelines for providing them with content.

It is important to note that commercial products are not Open Access products. They are designed to provide access to a limited audience, and as such limit your publications’ exposure. It is important to broaden one’s indexing strategy beyond commercial indexes and take advantage of multiple different indexes -- both commercial and noncommercial -- to seek the maximum exposure of your journal or publication to a wide variety of audiences.

### PKP Index

The Public Knowledge Project Index (PKP Index) is an openly available database of articles, books, and conference proceedings, based on journals or other publications that use PKP’s Open Journal Systems (OJS), Open Monograph Press (OMP), and Open Conference Systems (OCS) software applications. The PKP Index uses the Open Harvester System (OHS) software and hosts thousands of publications. It is not subject specific. The PKP Index is a good choice for your first index and is one way that you can increase the visibility of your journal.

In order to be included within the PKP Index, your journal must include at least one published item.  Tests, demonstrations, and empty installations will be rejected. So you’ll need to wait until you’ve started publishing before you can sign up. This will be true of most indexes.

#### Registering for the PKP Index

By Andrea Pritt

To register for the PKP Index go to the [registration page for the PKP Index](http://index.pkp.sfu.ca/index.php/user/register) and follow the instructions and ensure that you adhere to the requirements noted on the registration page.

Processing the registration might take a few days to a week or so, as PKP staff approve the registrations. Check back after a short time, and click on “Browse” to see an alphabetical listing of all publications that are included in the PKP Index and you should see your publication appear. Future issues will be automatically included in the PKP Index, so no further action is required on your part.
