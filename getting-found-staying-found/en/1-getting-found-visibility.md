# Getting Found: Building Visibility

The success of your journal depends on developing a
regular readership, who will become part of your scholarly
community, cite your content in their own work,
and tell others about the value of your publication.
To do this, however, they will first need to be able to find you.
This section examines a variety of ways to increase the “findability‟ of your journal,
through the use of commercial indexes, open databases,
libraries, the media, professional networks, and professional recognition.

## Journal Standards and Identifiers

By Roger Gillis

There are several different standards and identifiers
that are commonly used in academic publishing,
and it is important for journal managers
to become familiar with them and the role
that they play in the operation of the journal.
Although not exhaustive, this section will cover the most important
ones: ISSN (International Standard Serial Number), Digital Object Identifier (DOI),
and ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID).


### ISSNs

An important way of helping people find your journal,
and helping libraries and other organizations to make it discoverable, is to obtain an
International Standard Serial Number (ISSN). An ISSN is an eight digit,
international standard, which allows for any serial publication (i.e. any publication
that is published on a repeating or “serial”  basis -- journal, magazine, etc.) regardless
 of where it is published, the medium, language, or frequency of publication.
ISSNs are widely used by libraries, citation indexes, and the publishing industry to
uniquely identify and distinguish journals. They are often more important than the journal
title itself for serials management because they provide a consistent identifier throughout
the life of a journal. Even if the journal changes names, the ISSN remains the same. This is essential
for organizations like libraries and indexes to be able to identify and distinguish your journal.
Many external services, including indexing services, such as the [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org), require that journals have an ISSN.
A ISSN can be obtained free of charge from a [local ISSN Centre](http://www.issn.org/services/requesting-an-issn/).

ISSNs should be displayed on the journal’s website where it can be easily located, such as the footer or sidebar. If the publication has both a print and online edition, there is typically one for each. In OJS, you will be asked to enter your ISSN as part of the Journal Settings. This is used for metadata purposes and is not shown to readers. To make the ISSN visible in the journal footer, type it into the footer text field in the Website Settings. To make is visible in the sidebar, create a custom block.

For the final published version of an article (i.e., a PDF galley), you may also want to include the ISSN, along with the journal name and DOI (see below), on the final page or in the footer of the PDF of the article itself. This is important, as PDFs can be downloaded, shared via email, and become disassociated with the journal. You always want to provide an easy and obvious link back to your journal.
