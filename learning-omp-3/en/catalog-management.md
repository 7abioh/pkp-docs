# Catalog Management 
This chapter is about managing your press’ catalog, or the grouping of books that are available in various formats to the reading public located off the press home page, and displaying your published content for easy reader access. 

As the Press Manager or Editor, you can manage your catalog in a number of ways. OMP includes an overall Catalog Management interface that you can find on your left menu panel. You will also find a Catalog Entry tool for each individual submission on each submission page.

Authors may also assign their original submissions to various categories and series, and editors can change these assignments at any time.

## Create a new catalog entry 
You can create a new entry from the list of submissions in Catalog > All Monographs by clicking ‘Add Entry’ on the main panel submenu.
