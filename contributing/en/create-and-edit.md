# Create and Edit Documentation

Most of PKP's documentation is hosted and managed in a GitHub repository called the PKP Documentation Hub and displayed as a website using an open source tool called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). The content files that make up PKP's documentation are stored in the [Documentation Hub repository](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-docs) and you can edit documents and add new documents to the repository with just a Github account. This chapter explains how to edit and add new documents in the repository.

Each folder represents a document. Short documents consist of a single file and maybe an Assets folder of image files.

Longer documents consist of multiple chapter files, a README file, a SUMMARY file, and an Assets folder.

## Markdown

The files are all in a format called Markdown, a simple, easy-to-read, easy-to-write text format that allows users to generate basic HTML without knowing HTML language itself.  It uses simple tags to format text on a website. 

This is an example of markdown: 

`### Step 3

On **Step 3**, you will be asked to add more information about the submission, including the title of the submission \(broken down into prefix, title, and subtitle\), the abstract, and scrolling down...`

Here are three guides for writing markdown:

- [Daring Fireball Markdown Syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
- [Mastering GitHub Flavoured Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

## Create a document



## Edit a document

If you want to edit existing documentation or add a section or chapter to existing documentation, you can edit the document directly from the docs repository itself.

1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account if you do not already have one and log in.
2. Navigate to https://github.com/pkp/pkp-docs
3. Follow the directory structure in GitHub until you see the file you want to edit.
4. Click the filename to view that individual file.
5. From there, on the top right of the document window, you should see a small pencil icon.
6. Click that button to open up a plain text editor for the document within GitHub itself.
