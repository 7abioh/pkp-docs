## Contribute Documentation in Other Formats

We encourage users and community members to write and edit documentation in markdown and contribute through GitHub. However, contributed documentation can be created or edited in any format you want to work in, including a .doc or .odt text document, a Google doc, or an email message, and the Documentation Interest Group will convert the documentation to its final format when completed. Please do not contribute documentation in PDF, HTML, or LaTeX format.

Some documentation contributors prefer to create or edit documentation in a Word, Open Document, Google Doc, or another format. If youâ€™re creating documentation with a group of people, it can be easier to use a Google Doc than GitHub.

If you have created documentation in one of these other formats, you can email the file as an attachment or link to a shared document to [documentation@publicknowledgeproject.org](mailto:documentation@publicknowledgeproject.org). If you created documentation as a Google doc, you should send the link in an email message.

If you are editing an existing document, try to make it as clear as possible what you have changed.

Please include the following information in either the file name or the file contents:

- Title of the document, chapter, section, or webpage
- If your contribution is part of a larger document, the name of the larger document it is part of and where it belongs
- Your name and contact information
- Creation date
